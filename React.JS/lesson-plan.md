# React Lesson Plan

Prepared by Mr. Dipak Shrestha

## OVERVIEW & PURPOSE

### Overview
This 15-day course is designed for beginners who want to build a strong foundation in React.js. The course starts with essential JavaScript concepts specifically related to React, transitions to React basics, and culminates in students developing individual projects. Through hands-on learning and practical assignments, students gain the skills to create dynamic, interactive, and modern web applications.

### Purpose

* To provide a structured introduction to React for beginners.

* To equip learners with the necessary JavaScript skills for React development.

* To ensure learners can build, deploy, and manage React applications by the end of the course.

## OBJECTIVES
By the end of the course, students will be able to:

1. Understand and apply JavaScript concepts essential for React development.

2. Build functional React components with proper state and props management.

3. Use React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) for managing application behavior.

4. Style React applications with modern CSS techniques.

5. Implement routing and navigation in React using React Router.

6. Fetch and display data from external APIs in React applications.

7. Design and develop a complete project independently.

8. Deploy a React application to the web.
